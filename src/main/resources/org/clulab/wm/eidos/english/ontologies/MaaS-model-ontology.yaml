    - Version 2.0 estimates of total number of people per grid square for five timepoints
      between 2000 and 2020 at five year intervals; national totals have been adjusted
      to match UN Population Division estimates for each time point.This dataset is
      a mosaic of all WorldPop country level African datasets resampled to 1km resolution.
      The continental grouping of countries honours the macro geographical classification
      developed and maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division. For countries
      within each continental group which have not been mapped by WorldPop, GPWv4
      1km population count data was used to complete the mosaic. Full details of WorldPop
      population mapping methodologies are described at www.worldpop.org.uk/data/methods/

    - The population model is grounded on a method called Component Analysis (or Component
      Method) 1, which takes into account Crude Birth Rates (CBR), Crude Death Rates
      (CDR), and migration rates (inmigration and outmigration). Any of these rates
      may change in a linear or non-linear fashion.popt = popt-1 + popt-1 * CBRt*(1
      + birth_rate_fct) - popt-1 * CDRt *(1 + death_rate_fct) + Immigrationt- OutmigrationtIn
      this equaiton, death/birth_rate fct is applied to the nominal growth rates.
      It is used for sensitivity studies of changes in the growth rate. For example,
      if one uses a birth_rate_fct of 0.1 this will boost the nominal growth rates
      by 10%. These variables are put in place to account for any possible bias in
      the census data.

    - NCEP’s Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) is a weather forecast system that
      provides daily forecasts out to 16 days at 1 X 1 degree resolution at 6-hour
      intervals. This forecast product can be very useful to early warning famine
      and hydrological monitoring efforts, so the Climate Hazards Group (CHG) creates
      forecast precipitation fields at the dekadal (10 day) time scale and makes those
      available to researchers and decision makers.

    - Currently, the malnutrition model takes the following input variables CHIRPS,
      Consumer Price Index(CPI), population, cereal production per capita, consumption
      expenditure,Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),and month to predict
      the malnutrition rates for Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) and Severe Acute
      Malnutrition (SAM). According to World Health Organization (WHO) guideline,
      GAM and SAM are defined as weight-for-height z-score below -2, and weight-for-height
      z-score below -3, respectively. By this definition, GAM includes all categories
      of malnutrition.

    - Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) is a
      35+ year quasi-global rainfall data set. Spanning 50°S-50°N (and all longitudes)
      and ranging from 1981 to near-present, CHIRPS incorporates our in-house climatology,
      CHPclim, 0.05° resolution satellite imagery, and in-situ station data to create
      gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring.

    - We use LPJmL, a well-established dynamic global vegetation, hydrology and crop-growth
      model, to simulate wheat, maize and millet yield anomalies for 2018 based on
      climate, soil conditions and management regimes. Observed weather data are fed
      into the model until April 30, 2018; afterwards, to simulate the uncertainty
      of operational forecasts, weather data is sourced from the portion May 01-Dec
      31 from the previous years (1984-2017). The crop model runs on a global grid
      with 0.5° size in latitude and longitude.We provide yield anomalies as deviation
      from the mean of 2013-2017 as simulated by LPJmL. The data is available on a
      global grid and as nationally aggregated anomalies. Apart from a default simulation,
      assuming the same management in 2018 as for the previous years, we provide alternative
      intervention scenarios that assume different irrigation levels, more nitrogen
      input, or both. In total, there are 3 (crops) * 12 (scenarios) = 36 hypothetical
      back-casting simulations. Each of these scenarios is calculated for each of
      the 34 different 2018 climate realizations.
